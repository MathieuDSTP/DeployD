        <h3>DeployD.</h3>

<p>DeployD is an open source automated deployment framework for Windows. It's designed to make Windows deployments as easy as package management and publishing.</p>

<h3>Built on NancyFx and NuGet</h3>

<p>We're building on top of some cool open source tech to get this finished quickly. We love capistrano, appharbor and heroku and want the same kind of deployment story in our own private hosted environments.</p>

<h3>Simple Set Up</h3>

<p>We don't want to have huge server farm managing applications. We believe each node should stand alone, and support it's own tear up and tear down. Each node has it's own API so you can manage things remotely.</p>

<h3>Built in hooks for common tasks</h3>

<p>Web.config transformations? Got it. IIS management? Got it. Powershell hooks? Got it.
We want to make it as easy as possible to bend to your infrastructure without friction.</p>

<h3>Simple configuration</h3>

<p>Configuration is just another published package! All the agents will automatically synchronise with any configuration package changes and update themselves accordingly.</p>
